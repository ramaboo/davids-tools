## Saws

### Compound Miter Saw - Makita 10"

Perfect saw for chopping up 2x4's and other lumber. Maximum angle is 45°. I bought this saw for $5. Probably the best $5 I have ever spent on a tool. It even cuts aluminum (use the old blade for that!). 

### Track Saw - Grizzly [[T10687](http://www.grizzly.com/products/T25552?utm_campaign=zPage&utm_source=grizzly.com)]

An amazing tool for cutting plywood down into manageable or finished pieces. It makes very accurate straight cuts though 3/4" plywood. Bunny Bar v1, and v2 were both built with this saw. It takes 160mm x 20mm blades.

* 2 x 54" Tracks
* 2 x Track clamps

#### Circular Saw - Mikita 7-1/4"

#### Jigsaw - Hitachi


## Drills

#### Hammer Drill/Driver - Milwaukee 1/2" [[2704-20](https://www.milwaukeetool.com/power-tools/cordless/2704-20)]

A great general purpase battery powered drill. It's suprisingly strong. Be sure you have it in the right mode. If you tighten sockets on the drill mode it will twist your wrist really hard.

#### High Torque Impact Driver - Milwaukee 1/2" [[2763-20](https://www.milwaukeetool.com/power-tools/cordless/2763-20)]

This baby has more torque than most sports cars. It will drive a 24" stake into the playa without a sweat. Use the large batteries, wear ear plugs, and hang on.

## Welding

### Mig Welder - [[Lincoln Electric 140C](http://www.lincolnelectric.com/en-us/Equipment/Pages/product.aspx?product=K2471-2(LincolnElectric))]

![K2471-2](http://assets.lincolnelectric.com/assets/global/Products/K2471-2/300x300.jpg)

This is a great little welder. It runs on 110v AC and has a small gas tank so it fits into a car and can be used on site easily. It's good for mild (normal) steel up to 1/8" thick. So far it's built a bed frame, several tables, a four person bicycle, two gates, and steam boiler. It's a hot glue gun for metal and it's fun to use!

* Welding Hood - Autodarkning [[Antra AH7-860-0000](http://weldinghelmetcenter.com/antra-ah7-860-0000-welding-helmet-review/)]
* Welding Hood - Generic brand but still works

### Chop Saw - Ridged 14"

Great for cutting mild steel. It's noisy and smelly so used it outside.

#### Angle Grinder - Makita 4-1/2"

Comes in a red bag with the wrench you need to change blades and the optional extra handle. You're also going to want a **dusk mask**, **ear protection**, and a **face shield**. Use this tool with care and think about which way the blade is spinning. This tool likes to kick so hold it firmly and away from your body.
